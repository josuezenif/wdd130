    <h1>My favorite city is Cancun, Mexico</h1>
    <p>The reason why Cancun is my favorite is because of the beach, hot days, and most importantly,
        the <strong> food! </strong>
    </p>
    <p>Cancun is the most populous city in all Mexico. Cancun receives approximately <strong>9.72
            millions of international tourists.</strong> Many of those tourists arrive to one of the
        most famous and popular water park, Xcaret.
    </p>
    <p>Another reason why Cancun is my favorite city is because I have family there. My uncle lives
        there with his family, so whenever we go to Cancun, we also visit our cousins!</p>
