        <p>Hey, my name is Josue Zenif Baez Gomez. I am from Mexico, Saltillo Coahuila and I am 17
            years old!
            I am currently living in Quebec, Canada and I am working with my dad in his commercial
            cleaning company (Entretien Ménager Baez).
            I am studying software development in BYU-Idaho Online, planning to go present after I
            return from the mission.
