      <p>Hey, my name is Josue Zenif Baez Gomez. I am from Mexico, Saltillo Coahuila and I am 17
        years old!
        I am currently living in Quebec, Canada and I am working with my dad in his commercial
        cleaning company (Entretien Ménager Baez).
        I am studying software development in BYU-Idaho Online, planning to go present after I
        return from the mission. I enoy playing playing music and listening to music too, all
        kinds! I play the drums,
        the piano, the accoustic guitar, and I like to sing too.
        My favorite sport is volleyball! I like playing with my brother Alan and I would say we
        are a pretty good team! We are the Mexican Miya Twins! I enjoy playing many other sports
        too like fútbol, basketball, badminton, and TROMPOS!
        I speak 3 languages, Spanish, English, and French. I speak French because where I live
        (Quebec, Canada) the main language spoken by everyone is French. Quebec
        is the only province in Canada 100% Francophone, the rest of Canada is mainly English.
